    <p>The best way to get hackathon photos to your attendees, all for as low as $0.33/photo (pre-tax).</p>
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>The event organizers upload photos to the shared album via WebDAV.</li>
        <li>The attendee picks the photos they want to print.</li>
        <li>We zip it over to their local Walgreens where they pay in person</li>
    </ol>
    <p>You can also use it as a gallery by changing <code>/order/:id</code> to <code>/gallery/:id</code>.</p>
